# MDP REPRESENTATION

## AIM:
The representation of real world scenario using Markov Decision Process by stating all the states,actions and environment with respective rewards.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Traffic signal control optimization

### Problem Description
To learn the best timing for each traffic signal light to improve traffic flow while ensuring safety 

### State Space
The traffic signal has 3 Intersections or 3 states

### Sample State
Intersection 1 : 0
Intersection 2: 1
Intersection 3: 2
